# Flood in Jakarta: A history

"Jakarta is flood. Flood is Jakarta." That's an image of Jakarta that I had when I was in elementary school. In 2007, the news that my father watched, when I failed to conquer the remote control, covered story about the big flood that hit more than half of Jakarta. I was surprised because I always went there just for holiday. It was supposed to be a fun place. There when my 1940s-born father told me, "Jakarta has always been liked that. This time it just got worse than ever."
